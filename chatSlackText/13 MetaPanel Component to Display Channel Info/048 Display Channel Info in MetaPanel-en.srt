1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,900
Now we want to display channel information in each of the accordion segments that we created.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:14,980
And we want to do that as we change the channel so we want to provide dynamically to them at a panel.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:23,150
Information about the current channel so passed down current channel information as prox dramatic channel

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,300
component and more set that in state as the property name channel will do structure that our state object

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:37,160
and first within the header will grab channel don't name the channel name and we can channel details

6
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,960
where the accordion content we will just output channel about details.

7
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,160
The posters will cover that in the later section for our top posters and then in the last accordion

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,120
segment where we want to display who created a given channel will first use an image component which

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:08,190
will grab from semantic UI and we're going to set the source of that to channel that created by.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:17,150
Avatar can get the user's avatar created the channel and then underneath that or add the name channel

11
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,570
that created by that name will save both of those files.

12
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,720
And when we head back to our app we don't get anything because we're getting this error can't read property

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,240
name of no.

14
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,850
So it takes a certain amount of time for in our global state the channel data to be said.

15
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,800
So we want to set up a conditional where if we don't have a channel we're going to return NULL just

16
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,550
like we did with private channel.

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,170
So then as the channel data is put on global state we get information about it.

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:01,530
We get our channel details and we get are created by user and their avatar and name now another way

19
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,700
of handling this.

20
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:08,640
Waiting for a channel to come in is will remove the conditional and instead of returning all will a

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,700
loading prop to our segment.

22
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:17,610
So if we don't have any channel data we'll say not channel will provide a loading spinner to the entire

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,710
segment and then for each data each piece of data that we're getting will set up a conditional rule.

24
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:36,180
First make sure that we have channel data with say channel and then use the double and operator to display

25
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,830
the property on the channel.

26
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,000
We'll do that for each of those dynamic values that we added.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
So now we can see this loading spinner.

28
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,650
And as our channel data comes in

29
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,580
will refresh the page one more time so you can see that we're getting a floating splinter over the entire

30
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,470
metal panel.

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,120
And then as a last step or add a component to the last segment and put in the username and image into

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,090
that does the format be created by information a bit better.

33
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:19,860
I'll set this as an H3 set an image prop of circular on the image component.

34
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,250
So now if we take a look at our created by segment we can see that the user name is a bit bigger and

35
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,780
the Avatar where the creator is now circular.
