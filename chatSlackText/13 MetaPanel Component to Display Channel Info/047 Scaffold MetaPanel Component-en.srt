1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,030
Now let's go out our panel component which will include information about the channel that users currently

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,290
on.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,690
I had to the Minute panel file then are met a Panel folder import some components from semantic UI grab

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:27,670
segment accordion header and icon who use an accordion component here will be within a segment component

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,850
and first will have our header.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,470
It'll be at age 3.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:41,510
We attached to the top of the segment and we'll have the text about hashmarks and the channel name which

8
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,090
will display dynamically in a bit then we'll have our accordion component will be styled with a style

9
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:54,160
prop and attached as well by setting the attached prop to true.

10
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,690
And within our accordion component we have a number of segments each of which will be conditionally

11
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,410
shown when we click on the title.

12
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:10,040
So when you click on this first accordion title if the active index is zero and that's the index we're

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,680
going to give this part of the accordion if active index is zero it'll be active it will display the

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,710
content associated with the title that we're creating.

15
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:27,280
So add an active index property to state said initially 0 will restructure it within Rander.

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,620
So each of these tidal areas as well as their related content will have a given index and we'll add

17
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,440
an unclick to each of them if we click on a title we're going to set the active index and therefore

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,180
display the part of the accordion with an index of a certain value.

19
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,010
So two active index we're passing event and title prop's which will give us access to the index that

20
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,550
we set on the title.

21
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,140
So if we click on a certain part of the accordion we'll grab the index from the title props are passing

22
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,660
is that active index and also grab active index from St..

23
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:16,790
We're going to update active index with a variable called new index if active index is equal to the

24
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,740
index on our total props.

25
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:24,350
We get the value of negative 1 otherwise the index that's being passed when we click a given part of

26
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,290
the accordion and which will set new index to the active index it will update it and show that part

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,290
of the according with the given index value that we're setting in St. and within the title we're going

28
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,410
to put an icon first with the name of dropdown will be present within every accordion title that we

29
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,650
have in our accordion.

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,710
And then we'll add our own custom icon with the name of info here on this part of the accordion.

31
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,930
We're going to have channel details that we set for each channel

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,690
and then as I mentioned we'll have the content related to a given title to display those according to

33
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:13,600
the active index value will need to ground the active Prah that we supplied to the accordion title for

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,480
active index is being compared with zero.

35
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:24,360
And for now we'll just give our content the text of details we'll copy both the title and content and

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,660
paste another segment to the accordion underneath where will then change the index to one and compare

37
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,050
active index to one here.

38
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,840
Change the icon to user circle.

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:42,720
And our second icon this will be the area for our top posters and here with the accordion content we'll

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,740
compare active index with one again and then in the next segment that we'll paste and we'll compare

41
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,540
active index with to have an index of two Nikon a pencil.

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,410
Alternate the text will be created by within the title

43
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,250
compare active in text to within the accordion content.

44
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,660
The active prop and we'll just give it the full text of Creator for now.

45
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,170
So now we have our accordion we can toggle between different segments of it and we can see the default

46
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,430
text that we put in each area.

47
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,340
But now we want to hide the metal panel whenever we click on a direct messages channel.

48
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,740
We only want to see the metal panel to give us the user information whenever we click on a new public

49
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,440
channel.

50
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,950
So we're going after Jesus.

51
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,850
We're going to pass down and is private channel.

52
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:46,870
The value is private channel to our metal panel as we know we need to give it a key so that it renders

53
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:55,580
properly we give it a key with the current channel ID by first making sure we have a current channel

54
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,840
value and will receive that

55
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,350
in our state panel panel set the state property to private channel

56
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,710
and within render if we're currently in a private channel

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,230
and we can also restructure that from state if we're on a private channel.

58
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,040
We want to return not we want to return nothing.

59
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,870
We'll save that

60
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,790
and I'll try navigating to a direct messages channel and you can see that the Metapad goes away but

61
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,790
appears once again whenever we go back to a public channel.
