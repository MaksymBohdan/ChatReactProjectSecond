1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,740
Is move onto to a color panel.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,000
We created this button that we'll be able to click on and we want to display a model to our users for

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,510
them to be able to choose the colors of their app.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,890
So I want to create a kind of color picker or head of the color panel component.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:26,810
We're going to bring in a modal component the icon components and label components from semantic UI

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:38,580
nuance of first and an on unclick to our button which will open a modal.

7
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,590
So first we want to create a state object

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,500
with a modal property set initially to false and we've covered this a number of times.

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,660
We'll create an open modal function where it will set the State of the modal property to True.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,950
Copy that

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,890
will create a closed modal function which will set the modal property to False

12
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,310
and underneath the button will create our color picker model.

13
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:25,210
So this will consist of the modal component where basic styling will open according to the modal property

14
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,650
and stay cool.

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,050
The structure modal from St.

16
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,210
and all have an on close.

17
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,990
So to are close modal function

18
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,800
so intermodal Herse have a header the text to choose colors

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,980
then will have a content area.

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,930
And then add actions area

21
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,330
when actions will have two buttons.

22
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,390
The first the color green

23
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:27,960
proper inverted an icon within it with the name set to check mark with the text of saved colors.

24
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,600
Well copy that and paste another one in.

25
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:41,920
Underneath the color red the name of remove the icon and the text of cancell now within our modal content

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,570
area we want to show a color picker which will allow users to pick the color that they want for their

27
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,160
app.

28
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,330
We use the package re-act color for this which gives us a number of color pictures to choose from with

29
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,120
a number of different styles.

30
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,760
You can certainly choose any of the ones available that you see on their documentation page but I'm

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,390
going to choose the slider component that they have available so to import that up at the top.

32
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,970
Well grab slider picker from re-act color

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,050
and then we'll put that within our content area first with the label component or label it with the

34
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:33,270
text of primary color then we'll have our first lighter picker for the primary color of our app.

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:44,880
And then another label with the text of secondary color and another picker to choose the secondary color.

36
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:55,510
And once we save our files and take a look in our app at the moto by clicking on the button and our

37
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,540
color panel you can see both of our slider pictures.

38
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,390
And these are pretty neat because they allow us to pick a certain part of the color spectrum and narrow

39
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,640
down the color we want with these different shades.

40
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,020
And we also want to toggle the model by clicking on the cancellation.

41
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:22,070
So the last thing we'll do is add an unclick to our cancelbot which will reference our close model function.

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,340
So now we can show our color picker motile by clicking on the plus one and hide it by clicking on the

43
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:28,850
cancelbot.
