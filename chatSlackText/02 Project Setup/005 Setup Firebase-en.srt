1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,640
Are going to be using firebase is the back end and databased our project.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,040
Now firebase is a great choice for us since we're making a chat after we want users to be able to see

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,890
new messages in real time and firebase is what's known as a real time database it makes use of a technology

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,360
called web sockets in order to make data transfer very fast.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,450
So we'll create an account with firebase of the fire based at Google dot com and we'll click on.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,840
Once you've signed up go to a.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,480
We've taken the con. The fire based at Google dot com.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,410
We want to add a project by clicking on and project include our project name.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,200
I'll give mine the name of re-act slack clone.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:50,590
And you'll be asked to agree to their terms so quick the checkbox and click on Create project far based

11
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:58,210
on our create our project once our project is ready will click on the Continue button and will be taken

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,620
to a kind of admin panel for our project will begin by underneath the line get started by adding firebase

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:13,780
to your app will click on this code icon will give us some instructions and data will use to integrate

14
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,440
firebase with our web app underneath the Initialize firebase comment.

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:27,010
Want to grab both the Conficker object as well as the function call firebase start initialize app which

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,640
takes that config object or copy all that back to our app.

17
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,250
We're going to add a new file within our source folder for all of this and we copy it.

18
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,850
We're going to call this firebase dumb ass or pace that write in.

19
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,880
And since we're making use of firebase here and we're calling initialized app with all the configuration

20
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,620
data we're going to import firebase from firebase slash app

21
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,070
and we're going to import a few other packages as well.

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,940
Say So.

23
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:16,540
So dependencies I should say will import firebase slash off or authorization within our app

24
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:30,310
firebase slash database make use of the realtime database firebase flash storage Chole allow us to store

25
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,620
things like media files

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,980
at the very bottom we'll export firebase with export default.

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:51,920
To make that available to other parts of our app and if you'll notice the storage bucket property that

28
00:02:52,050 --> 00:03:01,120
has an empty string we want to set up our firebase storage we'll go over to the storage tab in the left

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:11,350
hand side and in that page will click on get started or show some default security rules for our storage

30
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,590
to say.

31
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,290
Got it.

32
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:25,100
And from here we want to grab the URL up of the top after the G-S Ford slash forward slash that you

33
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,230
all that ends with Spot dot com.

34
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,550
Paste it directly into our storage bucket property to set up firebase storage.

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,420
Now I can save that file and start making use of firebase within our re-act.
