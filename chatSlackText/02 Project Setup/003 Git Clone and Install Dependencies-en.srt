00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,500
Let's grab all the files that we need for our project to do so we'll go to the Euro get abduct com slash

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,710
for our act up as well as all the necessary dependencies for our project to grab these.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,310
We'll click on the cloner download burn.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,070
You can download all the files here as a zip file.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,480
When set of that will be cloning them onto our computer.

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:38,770
Click on the clipboard icon and we'll go to our terminal or go to my code editor's since it has an integrated

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,850
terminal.

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,790
And if you're using VS code you can get control and then the till the button in order to open that can

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:54,100
also get a view of the top and then click on terminal and from here we want to select the folder where

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,530
we want our project to live in.

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:02,030
So all CD into that folder or CD onto my desktop and then we'll run get clone paste and the you are

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,590
We take a look at that directory.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,800
We should see the folder new folder that was added a reac slack clone or just drag that into my code

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,610
editor to load all the files within it.

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,550
And once you've done that we will then install all of the dependencies listed within the package that

18
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,430
Jason File by running NPM install.

19
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,440
Or you can just use the shortcut NPM I

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,930
upon running this will have a node modules folder that contains all of our dependencies and we'll be

21
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,070
able to start up and begin building our re-act application.
