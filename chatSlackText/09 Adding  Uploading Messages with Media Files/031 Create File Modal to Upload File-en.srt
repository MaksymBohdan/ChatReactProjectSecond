1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:10,500
We're now able to add messages to a channel and see them displayed almost instantly within our messages

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,770
section you can switch to another channel and keep our messages within their respective channels.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,620
But now let's move on to our upload media button.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:27,660
We want users to be able to add images to their channels and we'll do that with an in our message form

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,670
component.

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,900
We want to create a modal property set initially because we'll be using a model just like we did with

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,580
our ad channel motile more channels component.

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:51,660
So we'll create a function called Open modal which will set the modal property in state to true to make

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:02,160
it visible or modal or adding a new media file and will connect this function to an on click handler

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,560
on or upload media button

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,690
into this player mode or put it within a custom component called File motile

12
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:27,180
and we want to pass down to our file modal first are modal value and state passes a modal prog.

13
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,920
So the structure that from stay within Rander class modal down to file modal as well as a close modal

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,350
function as a proper close model.

15
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,480
We can copy and paste our open modal function and modify it.

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,810
Be close model or we'll set the modal property of state within message form to pause to hide or modal

17
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,710
pass it down.

18
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,360
Or create a new file in our messages folder file modal

19
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,010
import reacts at the top.

20
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,680
This would be a staple component

21
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,290
will have its render and return

22
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,090
export file modal at the end.

23
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,770
You want to grab from semantic UI modal input button and icon

24
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,430
start with our modal component and on it will have the basic prop and basic styling.

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:04,260
The visibility would be talkable the open prop or pass the modal prop that we're getting from our parent

26
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:15,540
component down to it as well as close model or pass model to open and Antos of a value of close model

27
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,310
function.

28
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,510
And we'll have a header within our model that takes up select an image file

29
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:34,750
and we'll have a content section which will include the input where users can select a file will have

30
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:42,170
the proper fluid level of the file types that they need to include or have the label file types.

31
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:52,240
Jay pegan TNG name of it the name of this input will be file type will be file and underneath the modal

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:01,450
content include some buttons within a modal action section for the first button will have a color green

33
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,800
be inverted.

34
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,790
We can see the text

35
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:19,020
within the button tags will have an icon name so to checkmark in the text of send

36
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,970
to send our selected file or copy that button pasted in underneath.

37
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,990
Give it a color of red name.

38
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:42,590
Remove the text of cancel to cancel sending the given file and give it an on click of close modal

39
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,490
to be able to cancel sending a given file.

40
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,280
The back of our message form you need to import all modal up at the top.

41
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,780
From that sosh file modal

42
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,110
can save both those files.

43
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:16,930
If we click on upload media we can see our file model or we can choose a file we can hit cancel to close

44
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,420
the modal.
