1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,730
Within or upload for a function we have this state change.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:11,760
Listener which listens for the percent of the file that was uploaded and said the state with that percentage

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,120
would be nice to represent this upload state.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,590
Using a progress bar so create a progress for component to visually show or user.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,390
How much of the file that they've chosen upload has been uploaded to import re-act up of the top.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,960
This will be a stateless component.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,570
Now at the bottom we'll export our progress for

8
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,590
and then within message form we want to put the progress bar underneath the buttons.

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:54,560
So first we'll move the file model underneath the button group and put the progress bar component underneath

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,310
that and up at the top.

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:06,770
We need to import progress for should be in the same folder the messages folder

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,490
and we want to pass it to values from state.

13
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,640
In particular the upload state the string that represents where the upload

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:35,800
the images and the percent uploaded are past both of those as props so grab both upload state and percent

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
uploaded from our state object.

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,530
Will this add this line above the destructuring to make sure my editor doesn't reformat that or pass

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,990
upload state to the upload state prop And percent uploaded to the pre-sent uploaded Propp then or then

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,310
progress bar we can do structure those props from our object props object

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,260
and or conditionally show this progress component based on whether there is some text for the upload.

20
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:16,170
If it's in the process of uploading then we'll show a progress component from semantic UI

21
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,090
as progress component will have a number of prox will first give it a class name of progress underscore

22
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:34,160
underscore bar the percent or the width of the progress bar will be determined by our percent uploaded.

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:43,480
Now you will be a progress or we'll have this indicating prompt to give it some additional styles that

24
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,090
have a size of medium.

25
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,510
Well give it the inverted Propp

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,100
within applets Yes as well.

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:03,280
Add a section for progress bar and include or one class of progress bar

28
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:15,990
will have a margin to zero point three M's zero zero zero on all other sides and set two important will

29
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,610
save the

30
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,970
better apple.

31
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,390
Try uploading a file to your first channel.

32
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,130
Pick an image file or hit send.

33
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,740
You can see our progress bar at the very bottom giving us our upload state and since we have our image

34
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,700
in our first channel we can see the images uploaded and therefore the progress bar has a percentage

35
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,720
of 100 percent.
