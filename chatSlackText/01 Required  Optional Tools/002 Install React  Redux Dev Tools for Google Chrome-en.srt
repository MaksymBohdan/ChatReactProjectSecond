00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,280
Throughout the course of creating our app we're going to be working with a couple of browser extensions

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,650
that will make doing things like debugging and looking at state and prop's a lot easier.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,370
And these are the reactionary duck step tools that are available to anyone using either chrome or Firefox

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,440
browsers.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,580
And right now I'm going to show you how to install both of these extensions if you're using Chrome and

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,290
this will work for Chrome Canary as well.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:33,440
If you're using the developer version of chrome like I am.

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:40,780
So first when you have chrome open you had two of the top windows panel and head down to the extensions

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,700
option which will take you to the extensions page at Chrome forks Asheboro slash extensions.

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,790
You'll see all the extensions that you currently have installed.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,520
And just to know you can remove these in the future.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,690
So if you ever want to remove what we're installing right now just click on the Remove button back in

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,920
this page or click on the hamburger icon in the top left hand corner and in the side panel that opens

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,770
the very bottom you will click on Open Chrome Web store.

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:20,840
So here in the top left hand corner you want to search for first re-act tools or re-act developer tools.

16
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:29,540
And the first option that comes up should be the one that we want will then click on Abda chrome confirm

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,900
that we want to add the extension.

18
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,560
Click on Add extension.

19
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,280
We should see this confirmation window pop up that it's been added to Chrome

20
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:50,540
and now we need to do is search for Reducto tools and do the same again it should be the first option

21
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,740
that pops up quick on an extension

22
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:03,340
and then a second hopefully that should be added as well.

23
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,680
And all you'll need to do in the future to open these developer tools when we have our Riak development

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:18,390
server up and running is right click it inspect to open our console then click on the forward arrow.

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,260
Well see here when we're actually working with the re-act app a re-act option to open the dev tools

26
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,990
and the same will apply to redux.
