00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,970
Let's go over the tools that you'll need to have on your computer to complete this project first you'll

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,880
need to have installed.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,890
No genius you can get that at no jast dot org.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,190
And there you'll find options to download the stable version of note which is currently eight point

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,860
twelve.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,710
For the most recent version ten point ten.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,890
I'd recommend going with the stable version and it's the version that Noad recommends as well.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,230
We're using firebase for a back and for our database for our storage in this application.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,160
So you need to create an account with firebase that based on Google dot com and you can either do that

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,690
now or you can do it in the relevant section where we set up our base.

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:51,420
It's up to you and the code editor abusing which is optional of course is Visual Studio code and you

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,640
can grab it for free at Kodak Visual Studio dot com.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,070
There you'll find options for Mac Windows or Linux computers.
