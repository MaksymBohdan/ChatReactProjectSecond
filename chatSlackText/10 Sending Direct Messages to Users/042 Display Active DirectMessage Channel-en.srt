1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,330
Now just like in our channels component we're giving an active class to the active channel that we've

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,310
selected.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,150
We want to do the same with our direct messages so we can see which direct messages channel that we're

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,530
on.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,900
To do so within our direct messages state we'll have an active channel property

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:31,960
and then within change channel We'll update that property depending on the channel that we're changing

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:40,780
to that we're clicking on by calling that active channel passing in the User ID and will create that

8
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:50,430
active channel which takes the user id and sets the state sets the active channel property that we just

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,350
created with the user id

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:07,500
then will from our state object the structure active channel from render and add an active prop to a

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,270
menu item that we are iterating over or we'll compare the user id with the active channel value and

12
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,880
state will say that

13
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,080
if we click on indirect direct messages channel.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:31,260
Now we see a visual indication in our side panel of which direct messages channel that were on.
