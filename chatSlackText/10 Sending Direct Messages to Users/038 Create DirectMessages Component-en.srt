1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,140
Now it's great the structure for a direct message is component which will be underneath our channels

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,300
component that all allow users to send messages directly to other users.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,840
Within side panel and component direct messages on their channels.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,670
Create a file for it in the side panel folder.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,830
Over the top will import react.

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,590
This will be a staple component of all those classic direct messages

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:43,200
will have its return and render well make sure to export it at the bottom.

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,740
That's where a default will import it within side panel.

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,520
Before we forget

10
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,340
and will be in the same folder

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,350
and our direct messages the structure of the component will look very similar to how we structured our

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,800
channels component import menu icon from semantic UI

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,730
and our main component will be menu menu with the class name of menu

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,210
and it will contain a menu item.

15
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:39,130
Once again with this span an icon within it with the name mail.

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:48,420
The text in all caps of direct messages include our curly braces and our coats with a space in between

17
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:55,660
to space it from our parentheses which will include the length of the number of channels that will have

18
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,390
and will designate that with this user's property within state.

19
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:10,480
Will the structure users then render the number of direct messages channels with users not link.

20
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:17,390
Then I don't eat the menu item include a comment or tell us later that's where it will iterate over

21
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:24,470
the users that will be able to send direct messages to and back channels.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:32,130
You'll notice that we had a style prop on the menu setting Padam padding bottom to two homes or replace

23
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,350
that with the class name of menu and within after CSSA will create that Menu class

24
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,190
so this menu class will be within our side panel.

25
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,090
No just give it a roll where we set padding bottom to two m's.

26
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,700
Now we have the basic structure for our Direct Messages component.
