00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,880
In the past we've always had to add messages to channels by clicking on the Reply button in order to

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,780
create an alternative for our users to make sending messages a bit easier.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,530
Let's set up a key shortcut so that users can just press a succession of keys and very quickly send

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,810
off a message.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,250
We'll do this within the message form component and then the handle key down function or pass through

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:32,080
the event and on the event we'll check to see that they're pressing the control key with event control

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,760
key as well as the return key by checking to see if event DocI code is equal to 13.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,360
If that's the case if they're pressing both those keys at the same time we'll then send the message

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,500
to save that back to her first try sending a message the old way.

10
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,540
So pick an emoji and then hit reply.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:11,510
You see our message now can just type the message and hit control and enter and our messages added as

12
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,010
well.

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,940
So this just provides an alternative for users.

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,470
It's very convenient if you're sending a lot of messages if you're looking to make your own key shortcuts.

15
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,560
There's a very nice tool at Kiko dot info that will tell you the specific key code of any key that you

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,100
type in.
