1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:08,270
Whenever a new message is added whether we've added the message or someone else's out the message we

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,210
always have to scroll to the bottom of the channel in order to see it.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,140
It would be a much nicer behavior if we had an auto scroll down to the bottom whenever a new message

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,890
was added.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:30,100
So to implement this within our messages component will go all the way down to our common group.

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:38,140
And before the closing tag will add a div which will have Areff.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,770
Once again we use an inline function we'll call this ref messages and

8
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,510
and in order to whenever a new message is added scroll to the bottom of the channel to see that message

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,500
we'll use the component did update lifecycle method.

10
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:12,940
And even though we won't be using either of the parameters we have access to previous props and previous

11
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,000
state whenever our component updates

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:29,690
and if we have a raft of messages and we will execute a function called scroll to bottom.

13
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,560
So this will scroll our channel to the end

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:46,520
and we'll take the messages Endora and we'll use a method on it called scroll interview.

15
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,180
And within that we can put an object where we can set the behavior of the scroll and or set it to smooth

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,150
to smooth scroll.

17
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:05,090
This ref interview was no scroll to the div at the very bottom of our messages component.

18
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,230
And as you'll see this will be executed whenever our component updates.

19
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,720
For example we add a message.

20
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:25,790
We immediately go down to the bottom and it moves across the bottom very nicely and it all smooth scroll

21
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,990
to the bottom in any event whenever we have a new message added by us or another user.

22
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,320
Or if we see that another user is typing within the same channel

23
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:48,780
if I open my deployed application and log in with the different user and start typing

24
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,730
I'm taken down to the bottom both when the other users typing as well as when the message is added.
