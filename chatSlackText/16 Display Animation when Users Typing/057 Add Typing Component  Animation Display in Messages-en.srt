1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,680
Now move on to our Taiping animation for either of the users that are currently typing in a given channel

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:15,590
we'll create a typing component within our messages folder or first or import react.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,500
This will be a seamless functional component.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:31,180
Or we'll have a typing do with the class of typing which will contain three divs with the class of typing

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:42,130
underscore underscore dot at the end will export our typing component and then at the bottom of that

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:54,100
CSSA create a new area or a typing component or first we'll have a user typing class or font style or

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:02,860
be set to a taluk what we will be bold and it'll have a margin right of three pixels.

8
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,420
So this will be the text NextEra animation the typing class will have with five M's a height of Tooms

9
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:21,010
a position of relative padding of 10 pixels margin marked five pixels of background.

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,770
But the tax code U-6 E-6 E6 a border radius of 20 pixels

11
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,910
and our typing got class.

12
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:45,550
We floated to the left will have a width of eight pixels a height of 8 pixels a margin of zero and four

13
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,880
pixels in the background color of 8.

14
00:01:51,170 --> 00:02:01,820
The eight see nine one a border radius of 50 percent and opacity of zero and all create an animation

15
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,610
with the name loading Faid will be 1 seconds and will be an infinite animation.

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,920
We're going to select the first typing class with the aunt and child selector will select the first

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,580
typing up by passing that one will have an animation delay of zero.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:31,600
The second typing class will have a delay of two seconds and the third delay of point four seconds.

19
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,070
So the animation for each dot will be slightly offset to create or animation that keyframes with the

20
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:44,230
name of loading fade at zero percent the opacity of the animation will be zero.

21
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:58,640
That's 50 percent will have opacity of zero point eight and at 100 percent it will go back to zero.

22
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:08,830
So now in our messages component we'll make sure to import our typing components from outside typing.

23
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:20,110
And then to display it just to preview this will go within our common group or will create a span of

24
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,080
the class team of user underscore underscore typing.

25
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:32,070
And just as some sample text will say Douglass's typing include the typing component to the right hand

26
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:39,400
side and or at both the span and the typing component with a div with a style prompt with the style

27
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:47,880
rules display at the flex line item set to center and this will center our span and our typing components.

28
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,840
Along the y axis

29
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,130
so now you can see the text and our typing animation.

30
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,420
So this is what will be shown for any user that's typing within the same channel that we're currently

31
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:00,590
in.
