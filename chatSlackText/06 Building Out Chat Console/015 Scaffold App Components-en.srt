1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,480
Let's build up the basic structure for our component go to after jazz and remove the art class as well

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,210
as the component import from react or change to a stateless functional component.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,570
And it will have one component from semantic you I react.

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:24,780
The great component include a set of grid tags and within the grid will have a number of custom components

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:34,330
will have a color panel component side panel component messages component and finally a metal panel

6
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,170
component.

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,430
Will create a folder or a color panel

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:51,710
which will include a color panel component the top will import reacts.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,090
This will be a stateful component so it will be class color panel sends re-act up component will have

10
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,040
our render and return.

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,730
Now we'll just return to Divx.

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,560
The text of color panel and then export it

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,530
can copy all of this markup

14
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,710
and we'll create our next folder within the components folder side panel with its corresponding component

15
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,520
side panel and paste all that in all the markup be copied.

16
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,620
Change the class the side panel the text the side panel and the export side panel

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:49,990
will do the same for our messages component will include file of messages pasted in our markup

18
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,240
and change the class name.

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:03,150
The text in the export will have one final folder metal panel

20
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,740
with a component of the same name placed in the markup

21
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,410
so the class met a panel.

22
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:24,240
The text that met a panel and export the component within Apple import.

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:33,100
Each of these components then their respective folders color panel from color panel side panel from

24
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,910
side panel slash side panel

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,250
messages from messages slash messages

26
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,860
a panel from a panel slash panel and save all those files.

27
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,750
Take a look at our app component.

28
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,010
You can see the components are lined up next to one another.

29
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,960
Now we'll use grid to organize the components a bit better.

30
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,040
Set the comms to equal class the movie app and I'll give it a style prop with the background rule set

31
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,240
to the Texaco Tripoli

32
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,440
now will leave the color panel inside panel off to the side.

33
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,100
They won't have their own call or wrap messages and met a panel in a set of grid column tags

34
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,870
for messages we want to offset it from color panel inside panel by giving it a style Propp

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,400
and that will include a rule where a margin lapped reset to 320 pixels.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,830
I will do the same with a metal panel

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:58,760
wrap it in Grid column tags will give it a width of four.

38
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,170
Now since semantic UI uses a 16 point grid system this means that the metal panel column will take up

39
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:12,370
with the fourth of the page with we save that file.

40
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,140
Take a look at our out you can see the basic structure that each of our components within our chat will

41
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,470
have.
