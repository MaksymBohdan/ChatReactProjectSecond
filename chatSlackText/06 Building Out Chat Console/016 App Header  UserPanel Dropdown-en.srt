1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,680
With an IRA component we'll begin with our side panel.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:14,600
The first thing I'll add to it is a user panel or will be able to log out of the app withinside panel

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,890
or place the starting div with a menu component from semantic you react

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:30,290
and the menu will contain a number of custom components but first will add a number of props to it give

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:38,890
it a size of large gimpy inverted prop to make the text that will have within the menu light and color

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,080
and make it fixed to the left hand side of our app component.

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,290
It will be a vertical menu.

8
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,200
Will give it a style prompt where the background will be set to the tax code.

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,750
4c receive 4C and will give it a slightly larger than usual font size of 1.2 REM's

10
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,350
we save that.

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,140
Take a look at our menu here.

12
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:13,650
On the left hand side of the app as I mentioned we're going to add some custom components within it.

13
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,810
Then the menu tags first will be the user panel.

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,310
So we'll create the user panel component within our side panel folder

15
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:36,220
import re-act which will be a class based component a stateful component of our render and all return.

16
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,300
We all start out with a component of grid from semantic.

17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,900
I react

18
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:56,930
on it will set the style tag make its background the same Next go horse E-3 see 4C within our group

19
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,050
tags will have a column

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,900
row have a grid row.

21
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,050
We can have a number of rows within each column and on it will set the style.

22
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,710
In particular it's padding to 1.2 m's in a margin of zero

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,090
within the row tags

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,760
include a header make sure to import that from semantic.

25
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,420
I react

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll just add a comment bubblehead are saying this is our main application.

27
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:53,420
It in the head or we can have this set of content tags to specify the text content we'll make this dev

28
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:04,350
chat will give our header an inverted prop will float to the left and we'll make it an H to within our

29
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:12,640
head it will include an icon so import that will have the name code.

30
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,780
We save that mixture to export it at the bottom.

31
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,340
Export user panel

32
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,590
and then import it within side panel.

33
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:39,360
We save once again and see our dev chat had her up at the top with our code icon.

34
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,660
But on top of having a header within our great call column underneath the row we'll have a user dropdown

35
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,690
or a user can select a number of options.

36
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,520
And now we want to include the option of being able to log out of our app

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,830
and look for the closing tag for a grid call or add another header the style and it's paddings that

38
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,520
to point to five AMS and this will be as an H for an inverted once again.

39
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,030
And we'll put the dropdown component within the header will bring in dropdown component

40
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,510
will set the trigger for the dropdown.

41
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:30,750
What will trigger opening the options within the dropdown and an options Propp which will show will

42
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,910
display all the available options for our user.

43
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,520
The trigger will be a spam with the text of user.

44
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:44,510
The options will be a function which will execute as dropdown options.

45
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:53,190
So create dropdown options as a function on our user panel and will immediately return from that an

46
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,470
array and this array will have a number of objects within it would be a text property on each object.

47
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:06,330
For the first one we'll just have a span where it tells us that we're signed in as a certain user

48
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,070
and this first option will be disabled since it won't be something that we can click on.

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,790
We're just telling our user that they're currently signed in the next object will have text property

50
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,880
with this band set to change avatar.

51
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:31,240
Now a user will be able to click on this soon enough to be able to change their avatar.

52
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,210
And then we'll have an option for a user to sign out.

53
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:43,580
We need to provide key properties to each of these objects so I'll just give them different names.

54
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,800
Sample the first object will have a key of user.

55
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:55,440
Next will have a key of Avatar and The Last Word a key of Sino will save that

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,790
you can take a look at our dropdown and click on it.

57
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,040
You can see our options for change Avatar and sign up.
