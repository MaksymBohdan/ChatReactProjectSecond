1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,130
If we take a look at our loggin component by clicking on the log and link you can see that it's not

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,370
been built out at all.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,880
So we'll move on to creating that.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,610
But first I want to go to the head or component within register and change that to as each one and set

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,470
of each two just to make the header a bit bigger for appearances sake.

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:30,190
We'll copy all the markup within the registry component and then log in will select everything and paste

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,560
in what we copied from Register will change all of our code as needed.

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,970
Remove the import from the 5 we'll change the name of the class from register to log in.

9
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,900
We'll remove the properties username password confirmation and user's ref from St..

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:59,480
Well get rid of the validation functions and get rid of is form valid as well as is form empty and is

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,820
password valid.

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:09,820
Or remove the firebase promise or call and create user with email and password within our handle submit

13
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:19,200
we'll get rid of the call to save user so the save user function and we'll remove the structured values

14
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,420
for user and password confirmation and render.

15
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,900
And now we'll change the header to the color Violet.

16
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,140
Change the name of the icon within the header to code branch color of that to Violet and the text within

17
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,890
the header to log into dev chat.

18
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,160
Going to get rid of the user name input

19
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,420
as well as the password confirmation input change the button to Violet

20
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,650
we're going to change the message at the bottom to include the text.

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,680
Don't have an account.

22
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,640
Questionmark and link them to the register out with a text of register and at the end.

23
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,780
Make sure to export the logon component.

24
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:22,370
We save all that we go to log in can see our new form here.

25
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:29,710
The first thing we'll do within log in is we'll change the call to form valid to pass in start state

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,490
and create a new form value function.

27
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:39,670
We're going to structure the email and password properties and within the return we're just going to

28
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:47,860
check to make sure that there are values for email and password or using the end conditional and underneath

29
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:59,280
the set state and handle submit going to once again use the off function in firebase and then call sign

30
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:07,750
in with email and password which will take the e-mail value and password values and state however then

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,040
block which will give us the signed and user data from the user that just signed in.

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,910
So a log that

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,670
will make sure to catch any errors or catch block logged with canceled out error

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:35,010
and we'll set the state in particular we'll set the heirs property on state and concatenate the error

35
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,460
message on to our heirs array and set loading to false

36
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,910
save that had back and see if we can log in with a user that we've already registered with

37
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,940
type in their email or password.

38
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,690
If we pass an incorrect password you can see we're still getting our error message

39
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,450
if we type in the correct password.

40
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,300
We see our user information within the console.
