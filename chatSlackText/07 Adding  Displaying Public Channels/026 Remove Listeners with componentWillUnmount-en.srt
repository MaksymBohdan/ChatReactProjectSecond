1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,960
Relistening for any new channels added on our channels.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,950
When our channels component mounts with the ad listeners function.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,930
We also need to handle the case when our component announced for example go to a different route in

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,060
our app that we're removing those listeners that we set up so we're not listening for an event that's

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,070
not going to take place within the component will on Mt lifecycle method.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:31,040
We're going to call the function remove listeners and we'll be able to remove this channel's ref listener

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,740
simply by calling the off method on it.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,080
It's an important step that we need to take.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,540
We'll do it with every one of the listeners that we'll set up and each of our components to make sure

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:50,860
that our refs and our child graphs of that listener are turned off by calling the off method on them.
