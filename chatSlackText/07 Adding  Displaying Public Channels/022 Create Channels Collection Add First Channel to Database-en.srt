1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,810
We have our users collection in our database.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,840
Now we want to create a channel selection for every new channel that a user creates

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,590
collection of movie channels and all contain an array of unique IDs for each new channel that's added

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:26,500
and then Id contain the name of the channel that the user specified.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,200
The details about the channel

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,190
the unique ID

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,370
as well as some meta information about the channel namely who created the channel so created by will

8
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,180
be an object that contains the name of the user.

9
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,070
It made the channel as well as their avatar

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:07,120
and we can add that to take a look at what our channels collection looks similar to so our channels

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,030
question will be composed of an array of unique ideas and within them the channel information that the

12
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,580
users created back in our

13
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:28,570
will create a handle submit function which takes an event recall prevent default on this event.

14
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:37,180
Will set up a conditional check to see that the form is valid its being submitted will take the state

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,730
object and if it is if that function returns true or log channel added

16
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,480
will create this validation function is form valid and what the structure the values that we need from

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,430
state channel name and channel details the property names corresponding to our two inputs will be updated

18
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,520
as the user types in we want to make sure that there are values for channel name and channel details

19
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,160
and or connect our handle submit and submit handler to the form

20
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,580
as well as to the ABBERTON with an on click

21
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,330
I can say this and test it out

22
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,800
well try adding a channel open or con..

23
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,900
We don't have any values in the inputs quick and nothing is added.

24
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,380
We don't see the logo channel.

25
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,140
But if we type in the certain inputs we see the log channel added so our Hindol submit works only when

26
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,770
we have a valid form.

27
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,430
Now replace the log with a function add channel

28
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,760
create or add channel function.

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:11,930
Northen and channel will be reaching out to firebase to create a new channel within the channels collection.

30
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,060
Import firebase from two levels up.

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,580
We'll create a channel in our state object.

32
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:33,630
Once again it will be the database module and will create RF channels within and channel will structure

33
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,380
the channels raw from state.

34
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:47,170
First we want to create a unique key for each new channel that's added so create a variable called Key

35
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,490
will take the channels raw and use the push method and get the key property from calling push should

36
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:02,110
give us a unique identifier for every new channel thats added or create a new object called new channel

37
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,010
ruleset.

38
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,710
The idea of it to key the key variable name will be channel name.

39
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,420
So will the structure that from St..

40
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,700
Also the structure channel details for details property

41
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:27,720
that we have are created by object which includes the user name as well as the avatar of these that

42
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,300
created this channel.

43
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:38,020
So to get this information we need to pass the current user Propp and current user information from

44
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:47,620
our side panel down to our channels so pass it down as current user and receive that in our state with

45
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,610
the property name user set up process Krant user.

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,110
Also the structure that then ad channel.

47
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:07,920
So now the path to users name is used up display name and for their avatar its user dot photo Eurail

48
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,570
And finally will take the channels are

49
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:27,940
you put a child on it of the key variable you use the update function to pass new channel onto that

50
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,770
key.

51
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:41,230
Then one could again and will set the stage to clear both the channel name and the channel details from

52
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,880
St..

53
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,300
You could also make both channel name and channel details controlled inputs if you'd like.

54
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:55,880
Nor close the model analog channel added at the end will catch any errors.

55
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,810
The simple cancel error.

56
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,050
Now we've got all that we can save both files.

57
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,130
You can test this out

58
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,740
try adding a new channel

59
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,340
called this save food.

60
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,330
Say it's a channel about food.

61
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,710
Try adding it real quick.

62
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,310
Looks like we get our logo channel added.

63
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,180
Seems like it was successful and back in our database we have our channels collection our unique identifier

64
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:42,350
for one channel that was added as well as all the information we specified name ID details and are created

65
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,100
by object.
