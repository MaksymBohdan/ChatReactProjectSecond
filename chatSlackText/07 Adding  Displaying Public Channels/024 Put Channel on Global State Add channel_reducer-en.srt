1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,800
When we click on a channel we log the information about it but ideally we want to click on a channel

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:18,360
and put the channel information on global state on its own property and state to do so will first create

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,900
a new function called change channel

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,790
to accept the channel that we're clicking on

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,610
and we want to fire in action when we call this function with the name set current channel which takes

6
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:45,860
the channel data and puts the channel data on global state or place the console log within our display

7
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,050
channels function with change channel

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
and create this action.

9
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:03,010
We're setting the current channel in our redux state for first hand to the types file in our actions

10
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:09,160
folder and first we created some user action types.

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:17,410
Now we're going to create a set of channel action types.

12
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,940
First Channel action type we give them the same name of set current channel

13
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,720
and within our index

14
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,930
once again separate our user actions from our channel actions.

15
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,450
And so be interacting with a different part of our global state.

16
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:54,010
Export function called current channel looks up channel data no return an object with the type from

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:02,690
action types of said current channel our payload will consist of a property called current channel or

18
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,930
we'll put the channel data on it.

19
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:15,670
So within our reducers we're going to create a new reducer and sort of this user reducer which put information

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,240
on the user property of say we're going to create a channel producer for our channel data alone we'll

21
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:30,760
take the state and the action and I'll set up some initial state to call this object initial channel

22
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,210
state or initial channel state or consist of a current channel property set to no will have no channel

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,850
selected initially no set or state as the default value initial channels the default value of our state

24
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,110
will set up a switch statement or switching based on the type of the action.

25
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,930
And in the case that we have Bissette current channel action type or return an object in which we spread

26
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:07,090
all the initial values of the state and only change the current channel property of it according to

27
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:15,630
action that payload that current channel with the channel data that's coming in.

28
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:24,610
I made one small error with the clear user case we want to spread the state and not the initial user

29
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,050
state and in the default case for our channel producer we want to just return the state if we don't

30
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,970
have a match for any case.

31
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,460
We'll put the results of the Channel producer within combined reducers to a new property channel.

32
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,330
So all of our channel data will exist on this channel property of global state and back within channels

33
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,390
we can use our set current channel action.

34
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:03,950
We just need to import the connect function from re-act redux up with a top and then import the action

35
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,930
that we want to use so that current channel

36
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,120
and since we're importing that up at the top we also need to connect

37
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,820
and wrap our component with it.

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:34,240
Well said Matthysse to props to know and the structure or action from Matt dispatched to prop's.

39
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:42,410
So we'll save all of our files back in our app.

40
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,020
We take a look at our read ex-state.

41
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,010
Take a look at our state object you see that we have this new channel property with the sole property

42
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,560
of current channel set to know.

43
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,100
And if we click on the channel you can see that it's populated with our channel data.

44
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,820
So we're putting our channel data now on mobile state

45
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,970
if we select the other channel that we have.

46
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,330
You can see we get its channel data as well so able to switch between channels and alternatively put

47
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,150
the respective channel data on local state.
