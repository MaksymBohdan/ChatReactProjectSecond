1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,320
Within our chat we'll have a number of channels that users will be able to add messages to.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:11,790
We'll add the channels component underneath our user panel component in our side panel then the side

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,920
panel file.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:23,500
We had channels underneath the user panel component and add a file for it in the side panel folder of

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,230
the top of channels will import re-act from react.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,320
And this will be a staple component we'll call this class channels

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,920
will have its render in return and will make sure to export the class at the bottom

8
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:51,790
but then the return are going to include this menu menu component menu up manual be a child of the main

9
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,040
menu component thats within our side panel and we will make sure to import menu from semantic you react

10
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,890
and on the opening tag sort of outcrop with padding bottom set to two m's.

11
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,520
So give it some padding on the bottom.

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,260
And then you a manual have a menu item within it.

13
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,660
That will contain a spam with an icon so grab that from our import as well.

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,050
Or icon will have a name of exchange.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,940
And on the right hand side is Icon will have the text channels.

16
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,070
So this will basically be the heading for our channels component.

17
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,370
Then underneath the spam will have a set of parentheses which will include the number of channels that

18
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,870
we currently have.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,430
So create a state object had a channel's property which will be initialized to an empty array and will

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,670
the structure of the channel's property from state within or render

21
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,770
we're going to get the number of channels

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,060
using Rollings property.

23
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,330
We will interpolate channels that length into the right hand side of that we'll have an icon the name

24
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,420
for that will be added

25
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,320
then underneath the menu item will eventually show all of our channels which will iterate over.

26
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,480
So I'll just add a comment there for now.

27
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,650
And back with inside panel import channels from dot slash channels.

28
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,810
Since it's in the same Polder say both those files

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,120
backed her out.

30
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,810
Now I can see our channels Hetter channels text as well as the number of films that we have.

31
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,570
And in order to space out the title from the number of channels we can add this set of curly braces

32
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,300
and double quotes with the space in between to space out the text from the number of channels.
