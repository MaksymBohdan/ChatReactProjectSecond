1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,400
We want users in or out to be able to add new channels by clicking on this ad icon and when they click

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,700
on this icon We'll show them a model which will allow them to provide a name for their channel as well

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,690
some details about it to create a mobile component will import it from semantic UI

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,020
This will be our ad channel mobile

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,240
and on the opening tag of our mobile.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,610
We had some props.

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,630
We'll get some basic styling with the basic prop.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,400
We use the open prop in order to target toggle the visibility of our motile.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,060
We'll do that using a property in state called motile will initially be set to false and we can do structure

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,340
from our state object in our render function.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:54,300
So pass that to open if we set that to true we'll be able to see our model and we'll have an enclosed

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:02,700
Propp which will be set to a function called Close modal where all it will be irresponsible for doing

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,940
is setting the model property within state to false.

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,270
So again this will set the open property false and hide our modal

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,650
will add a header to our model with modal dot header.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,630
You know the text of our channel includes some content

17
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:33,580
and in our model we'll have both the form component and a couple of input components.

18
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:47,410
So will outperform and the form will have a couple of foreign fields and these will include our input

19
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,000
components give it the proper fluids to take up the full width

20
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:02,300
of a label attribute with the person in the name of channel a name attribute of channel name and an

21
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,160
onchange set to this start handle change.

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,050
We want to update the state object according to the Name property of the input that a user is typing

23
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,550
in so past an event to handle change.

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:23,440
Was that the state set the property according to eventa target that name and the value of that or B

25
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,650
event or Target or value

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,090
or had a state property of channel name and another one of channel details so have another input.

27
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,940
With the name of channel details right underneath our first input will copy the entire form field and

28
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,940
pasted in underneath that name to channel details and the label will be

29
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,360
about the channel

30
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,730
underneath the modal content.

31
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,340
We'll have this Modal actions area and this will include a couple of buttons or we can optionally add

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,930
a channel or cancel adding a channel so bring in the button component from semantic UI

33
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:24,500
the button will have a color prop of green We'll have the inverted prop include an icon with the name

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:33,770
of checkmark in the text of ADD we can copy this button and paste it in underneath.

35
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:45,980
With the color of red the name of remove and the text of cancell.

36
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:56,540
And since we're returning to components our menu component in our modal component we need to put everything

37
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,140
within a single component using reactant fragment.

38
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:11,740
This is a good way to group two components or multiple components to return just one component within

39
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,660
a file.

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:27,540
You can add an unclick on our ADD icon to open modal so also have a function called Open modal which

41
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,060
will change the modal prop in state to true

42
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:42,110
to show the model in Sabor channels file and back to your app will try opening a modem by clicking on

43
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,700
the icon that opens our ad channel model will head to our re-act dev tools

44
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,590
and search for the channels component

45
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,620
we'll type into our name of channel and about the channel inputs we can see corresponding properties

46
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,700
in state or updated.

47
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:14,070
But our cancel button isn't working we're going to have an unclick to our cancelbot and we'll set that

48
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,100
to reclose model function which will close the model if we want to cancel adding a channel

49
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,480
so we refresh our app we can open the model and host the model.
