1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,590
Are now able to put the channel in Google say when you click on it.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,780
But when we load the page we're only calling the set user action.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,760
We're not putting any channel in our global state when our page loads.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,660
We have to actually click on it first.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,150
We want to change this behavior.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,820
We want to load a channel by default.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,690
When our page floats

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,350
we create this we begin by going to our ad listeners function and where we're setting the stage we're

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,400
adding the loaded channels to our channels property and say we're going to add a callback function.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,870
We're going to execute a function that will create called Set first channel

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,220
and Secrest channel will do just that.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,730
I'll take the first channel in R.A. or channels or hey and put it on global stage.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,150
We'll set a conditional to say if Purslow to put a personal property in state so that initially the

14
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:08,250
true say if this that state that first load and this starts date that channels the length is greater

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,460
than zero if it's our first time loading the page and if we have more than no channels we have a channel

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,080
we're going to call our set current channel action and pass in the first channel.

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,280
And how do we get this first channel.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:35,140
We'll just take the channels or a from this state that channels and grab the first element and set that

19
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,720
equal to the variable first channel

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:50,860
and then upon doing that we want to set the state in order to set first load to false.

21
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,430
We can say that and back to our

22
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,550
You can see now set user and current channel are being called when our page loads so now we have our

23
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:10,540
first channel within state and we can still change our channel to another one.

24
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,060
However we're not displaying which channel is currently active.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,050
We want to change this as well.

26
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,460
We want to displayed our user which channel has been selected who will then change channel.

27
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,110
We're going to execute a function who's going to take which channel we're passing to change channel

28
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,900
in order to set the active channels or to call this action an active channel.

29
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:47,070
We'll simply take the channel data for the channel that's being switched to and set the state and update

30
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,140
a property on state called active channel.

31
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,790
It will just take the ID of it

32
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,440
we need to create this active channel property

33
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:10,680
we'll set it to an empty string initially and then back where we're iterating over our channels with

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,440
display channels.

35
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,670
We'll add this active prop to our menu item to compare.

36
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,170
If the channel that's currently being iterated over if it's ID is equal to this that state got active

37
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,500
channel and if it is it'll provide an active class to it and highlight it.

38
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,260
When we get back to our app

39
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:45,170
when our page loads and we click on a channel you'll see that we have some indication of where we're

40
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:52,490
currently at which channel we're on over we're not displaying it for the first half that we land on

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,260
if we want to change that.

42
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,870
We want to show that the current channels active when we're calling said first channel you can call

43
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:08,520
that active channel as well and passen first channel.

44
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,660
And with that we're now setting the channel by default.

45
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,800
When our page loads in or displaying the channel that's currently active.
