1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,550
Let's move on to building out our color panel and messages components will start with the color panel

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:13,410
which is on the left hand side of our side panel and within it will import a number of things from semantic

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,100
you react

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,480
or grab the sidebar menu divider and Button components.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,470
So the main component will be a sidebar.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:35,210
We want to use the as a prop to make it as the menu component that we imported will have additional

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:35,840
props.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:46,590
I can set the labeled as was inverted vertical visible with a very thin and within the sidebar.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:55,470
First have a divider to divide it from a button underneath with an icon of and have a size of small

10
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,780
and its color will be blue and say Will that take a look at it.

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,960
You can see a thin black color panel on the side with one blue button.

12
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,160
Now moving on to messages

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,030
Lamport from semantic UI

14
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,680
segment and comment and replace the starting to first of fragment.

15
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,570
We're going to group a number of custom components together within this fragment.

16
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:40,730
The first of which will be messages header component and we'll have our segment with a comment group

17
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,450
within it.

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,790
Which is where it will eventually put our messages and we'll give it a class name of messages this comment

19
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:55,750
group then underneath the segment we'll have another custom component of message form.

20
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,450
So first will create the file for our messages header within the messages folder.

21
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,620
So import react the top.

22
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,040
This will be a staple component go to the class name of messages header

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:23,760
will have its render and return and will first make sure to export it at the bottom.

24
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,150
Then at the top will bring in some components from automatic UI

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:42,910
or grab header segment and put an icon or begin into segment to group related content and we'll add

26
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,100
this clearing Propp.

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,970
Since we're going to be using a few floats within the segment.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,820
This basically works as a clear fix when we float items to one side or another.

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,150
The header will have a fluid set to true will be as needed to be close to the left will give it a style

30
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,240
proc with margin bottom set to 0 and within our header here the text of channel and then to the right

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,980
hand side will have an icon with the name of star outline and the color for it will initially be black.

32
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,490
Will wrap the channel icon in a spam

33
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,260
and underneath the span tags will have a sub header for our header component which is where it will

34
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,520
show the number of users for a given channel.

35
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,550
For example two users are now oniony they will have another header which will be added to the right

36
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:49,660
so have an input and on that input give it a size of many icon will be search

37
00:03:52,570 --> 00:04:00,890
the name will be search term and placeholder for the input will be search messages.

38
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,490
So this will be an input to search messages in a given channel and will just add a comment at the top

39
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:13,090
for our first hour of channel title and the second header will be channel search and put

40
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,680
the now back in messages we're going to import messages header from the same Polder

41
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,850
and now moving on to our message form create a new file for that and our messages folder

42
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:46,090
are again will import reac is again will be stateful.

43
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:52,740
The class message form extends react or component render return or export it

44
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,180
at the top will import from semantic UI.

45
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,490
Segment button and input

46
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,220
will begin with the segment again.

47
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:23,870
Give it a class name of message underscore underscore form within the segment of an input.

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,180
Here's where we'll be adding new messages to a given channel proper fluid.

49
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:41,470
The name of message style profit margin bottom set to zero point seven times a label which will include

50
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:49,550
a button which will have an icon of ADD or put the label to the left hand side.

51
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,060
The placeholder for the input will be.

52
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,840
Write your message then underneath the input will have a button.

53
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,890
Group will have a couple of buttons which will have proper icon and the width of two

54
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,690
so first button will have an orange color.

55
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,860
The content for it.

56
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:22,970
The text on the button will be ad reply and the label position will be left where the icon which will

57
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,040
be added.

58
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,480
Then the next button

59
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,700
in addition to being able to add or apply are going to have a button that will allow us to upload some

60
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:41,740
media with the color of green content of upload media or label position where the icon is right and

61
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,190
the icon is cloud.

62
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:53,760
Upload and once again with messages will import our component of message form from the same folder.

63
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,460
Well say that now we can see the basic structure of our messages component.

64
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,640
Now as you notice things are a bit stacked at the top.

65
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:15,890
We need to add a new section in our app that see as file first for our messages class with the height

66
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:24,540
of 440 pixels and overflow y of scroll.

67
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,120
This will be for our messages area where we can look at all the messages for a given channel then will

68
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,480
have a message form section with message.

69
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,680
Underscore under-perform the position of fixed and set to important.

70
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:48,500
The bottom for it will be 1 m margin left will be 320 pixels and important as well.

71
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,910
The left will be set to zero right one m and z index 200.

72
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,910
So it appears in front of everything else.

73
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,210
Say that.

74
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:10,370
Now I can see our messages area takes up much greater height and our message form takes up the majority

75
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,690
of the remaining with.
