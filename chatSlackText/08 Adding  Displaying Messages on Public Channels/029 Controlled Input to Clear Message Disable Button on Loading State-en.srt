1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,430
We added our first message to our messages collection in our database where we didn't clear the text

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,700
in our input upon adding it.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,070
So to clear that value whenever we add a new message or make our input and our messages form a controlled

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:22,800
input are passed on the value from our message property is being updated to our input component with

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,260
the value prop

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,910
or also disable or button upon adding a new message by setting the disabled prop to the loading value

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,810
of loading said to true it will disable our button while our messages message is being added.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,650
So the structure loading from state as well.

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,980
So now when we clear our message property and state upon adding the message will also clear the text

10
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,400
that's within the input as well.

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,720
So now when we add our apply the text and the inputs queered our button is disabled for a split second.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,270
Upon adding the reply.

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,170
And we have another new message within our database.
