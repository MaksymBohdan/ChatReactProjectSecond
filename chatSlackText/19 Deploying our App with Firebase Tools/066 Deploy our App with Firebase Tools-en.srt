1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,280
Now move onto deploying or add to the Web will do so using the NPM package.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:13,530
Firebase tools so enter terminal and the development server and it's all Firebrace tools as a global

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,980
package with the dash g flag.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,450
You might need to put sudo in front of it according to your user's permissions and once it's installed

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,770
run the command Firebrace log in will be asked to log in to firebase using Google or.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,590
And once it's done you run firebase in it to initialize our Firebrace project then the CLIA is going

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,130
to take us through a number of steps.

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,910
The first will be to choose which sealife features we want to set up for this folder and will select

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:50,040
both the database and storage options with our spacebar and so we use both of those in our project and

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,590
then hit Enter then we'll be asked to choose the firebase product that we want to deploy we select that

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,330
and then it'll ask which file should we use for our database rules.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,550
We'll choose the default of database type rules that Jason as was the default for the storage rules

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,900
storage rules.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,440
Jason what this will do what I will do Ozel bring in all the rules we specified in our firebase console

15
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,410
and put them as a Jason file within our project.

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,670
So very quick on database rules that Jason we can see all of the rules that we just set up in the past

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,020
couple of sections and the same applies to the storage rules file.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,450
We'll head to this firebase to Jason file that was also added and we're going to provide some additional

19
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:42,230
configuration here to tell firebase hosting how to host our first will run the command NPM run build

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:51,230
to create a production version of our re-act up that should have taken all of our javascript files and

21
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:59,230
bundled them into this build folder for production and to deploy it out to the Web.

22
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:06,390
We need to add a configuration setting within our Harbi So Jason will add a property name of hosting

23
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:15,870
the adjacent object in which we're going to tell the Selye to look within the build folder and make

24
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:25,170
it the public folder that will deploy to the web once we've configured that or run firebase deploy and

25
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,140
deploy everything within our build folder.

26
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:38,510
And at the very end we'll tell us or hosting your show where we can find our out on the web will pay

27
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,970
said in to our browser you can see our starting up as usual.

28
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:54,060
We can log in the preexisting user Oregon register hit submit and see our app startup as usual or provide

29
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:03,210
a new message to show that we actually deployed our project and that is running live on the web.
